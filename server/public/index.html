                <ol>
                    <li>Show the AI how you're communicating with your partner. Just copy and paste a sample of your conversations from text or email</li>
                
                    <li>The AI will review each message, tag it with some helpful commentary, and then generate a detailed report summarizing the nature of the exchange, what it says about your relationship, and advice for both partners to communicate better.</li>
                    <li>Chat with the AI and ask questions about the analysis or other aspects of the relationship</li>

                    <li>Share the results with your partner (if you want to). Your session is totally private and confidential, and can only be viewed with your explicit permission</li>

                   <h2>Help and FAQ</h2>
    <p>Is this only for long term, monogamous couples<br>No! LoveGPT is tuned to give useful advice for any interpersonal relationship - anyone who you've had a conversation with, even someone you just met</p>

    <p>I'm gay or trans, will the app still work?<br>
    Yes. The AI has been programmed to focus on the quality of communication and the dynamic between the partners - and it deals with whatever issues are being discussed. Your gender or sexual orientation does not affect the results (unless of course the conversation you provide is focused on those topics, in which case it will customized advice just like it does for a straight couple)
    </p>

    <p>What about platonic friendships and work relationships?<br>
    If you are seeking analysis and insights into a non-romantic relationship of any sort, we recommend you provide context when you submit the conversation. This can be as simple as "This is a conversation with my coworker who I've worked with for 8 years". The only limitation really is that the AI has been tuned to handle 1 on 1 interactions... currently it is not set up to deal with multi-party group conversations, but we're working on it
    </p>
    
    <p>What is the actual AI technology behind this app?<br />
    Currently we are using a custom tuned version of GPT 3.5, that has undergone specific training for this purpose and has a 4x larger memory than the GPT 3.5 that you may be familiar with from ChatGPT. We will be upgrading to GPT-4 within the next 1-2 weeks, before we start charging customers to use the service
    </p>

    <p>How do I know if I'm getting good advice?<br>
    Use your judgment. Think critically. The AI is playing the role that a human therapist or mediator would have played in the past, so the output is just one perspective on the issue. If it doesn't feel right, ask the AI to explain its reasoning.
    </p>

    <p>Will it give the same advice every time?<br>
    Not necessarily. Some people find it useful to analyze a conversation multiple times, because the AI might focus on different aspects or provide an additional perspective that it missed the first time.
    </p>

    <p>How long does it take?<br>
    It depends on the length of the conversation you provide and on how busy the server is. Long conversations can take up to 3 minutes to analyze - please leave your browser open while you are waiting for the results</p>

    <p>How much text do I need to provide?<br>
    It really depends. If you give it a few messages and the result is vague and unhelpful, try giving it a bigger sample of the conversation. There is a ~3000 word limit on the length of the content you provide, so try and choose a chunk of conversation that reflects the issues you are trying to gain insight about.
    </p>

    <p>How did you come up with this app?<br>
    I first thought of this 20 years ago, when I was in college, because I seemed to be the person everyone came to for advice on their love life, and they would show me texts or email exchanges and ask me for opinions about whether their partner was serious about the relationship, or how to respond to their message. But back then there was no AI, and it seemed pointless to simply count emojis, compare response times, etc... In 2017, an early prototype of this app was developed using new sentiment analysis technology but it still didn't provide any insight that wasn't obvious to a human reading the messages. It is only in the past year or so that app developers have access to powerful AIs that can analyze interpersonal communications in an open ended, meaningful way on par with professional counsellors, and therefore it is finally possible to offer this service to the public 
    </p>
    
    <p>Does it work on all devices? <br>
    Yes. Anything with a modern web browser should work. We've tested it in chrome and safari.
